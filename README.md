# Flexibilidad

## Flexbox layouts made simple

### DESCRIPTION
Flexibilidad is mostly inspired in Material Angular layout (by google). But we like to have an isolated and modular grid system usable in all kind of projects and not only AngularJS.

#### Why flexbox?
Flexbox provides simpler and more flexible layout:
- Easy vertical alignment of content within a parent element.
- Easy reordering of content across devices and screen resolutions with the help of media queries.
- Easy CSS-only equal height columns for your grid-based layouts.
